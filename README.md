# LPC1769 Drivers

These set of drivers are designed to work with the NXP LPCXpresso1769 rev D2 and were used on a personal project for a course I took at University 
(Shuold work with latter or older versions too).

This is a clean fully-functional and unmodified version of the one I used without the additional code that would make it otherwise useless.

## Requirements/Dependencies

These drivers where designed and compiled on the Linux version of [MCUXPRESSO IDE](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE).
